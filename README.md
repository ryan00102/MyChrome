When I was working on a small personal project, I made just three HTML, CSS, and Javascript files, and I wrote the code by cramming all the functions into the Javascript file, but it was hard to organize and complicated in my head.

So, after identifying the functions that I will implement as much as possible, I made a Javascript file according to the functions.
